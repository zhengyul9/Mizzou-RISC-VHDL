What is the function of GENERIC?

Generics are commonly used to specify parameters for a component in such a way
that the parameter values may be specified when the component is instantiated.


How can one instantiate a Generic component?

Generics are declared before the ports. For a component with generics, a generic map declared before the port map. This allows a value to be set for the generic.
